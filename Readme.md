# Rust Standard Libary Learning

I am using this repository to study the rust standard library, either by creating small examples / POCs or by recreating functionalities myself.

## CI testing

Small changes to test branch protection settings

Another small change to test main branch merge request status checks

Yet another small change to re-trigger status check on new commit for existing merge request
